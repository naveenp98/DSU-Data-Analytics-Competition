# Competition
Repository for competition

Use your own folder when making models. Each folder will have a solution that I have made for your reference. Ensure you save your work as 
'FIRSTNAMEINITIAL''LASTNAMEINITIAL''MODEL''MODELNUMBER'.
For example, if I have 2 models, I would save it as - 
NPModel1
NPModel2

Happy programming!
